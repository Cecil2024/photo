# 📸 Photo Portfolio

Welcome to **Connie Ramirez Photography**, your go-to platform for exploring our portfolio and booking a variety of photographic services. Here, you will find outstanding examples of my work, along with contact information and links to my social media. The platform is built using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind, and it seamlessly integrates booking and payment options, making it easy for you to schedule and pay for my services.
